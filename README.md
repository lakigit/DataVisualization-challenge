Module 5 Challenge

#Background
A new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
Here include all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study.
This project includes the following:
summary statistics.
bar charts and pie charts.
Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
Calculate correlation and regression.

# Summary
I first looked for duplicates and found one duplicate mouse ID, which was g989.
I dropped that ID and cleaned the data set before continuing my analysis using the cleaned dataframe. 
When examining the summary table, I noticed that Capomulin and Ramicane had the least tumor volume. 
Moving on to the bar chart, it was clear that Capomulin and Ramicane had the greatest number of observed mouse time points, and they performed similarly. 
The pie chart revealed that there were more male mice than female mice. 
When considering the treatment regimens Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, I observed that Infubinol and Ceftamin were the worst, and there was an outlier for Infubinol. 
The line chart indicated that Capomulin decreased tumor volume, and I concluded that there was a positive correlation between weight and tumor volume.
In summary, Ramicane and Capomulin were the strongest-performing drugs compared with others.
